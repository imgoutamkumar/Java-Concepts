Polymorphism is an object oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.
There are two types of polymorphism.
 1. compile time polymorphism(static polymorphism)
 2. run time polymorphism(dynamic polymorphism)

 Method Overloading
*If two or more methods have the same name but they should have different parameters or signature is known as overloading.
*Solved during compile time.

 Method Overriding
 *Child class inherits methods with the same parameter/signature which are presents in the base class is known as overriding.
 *solved during run time
