Lambda is anonymous function
 -No Name
 -No Modifier
 -No Return Type

Benifits of Lambda
 -Reduce the lines of Code
 -Sequential and Parallel excution support by passing behaviour as an argument in methods
 -To call APIs very efficiently
 -To write more readable maintainable and concise Code

*Java compiler also inter the type of variable passed in arguments, hence type is optional

*If the interface contains only one abstract methods then it is called Functional interface
EX: Runnable, Callable, Comparable etc
To call lambda we require functional interface
Lambda is used to implement functional interface in very simple and short maner.
